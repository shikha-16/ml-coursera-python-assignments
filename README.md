This repositry contains the python versions of the programming assignments for the [Machine Learning online class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) taught by Professor Andrew Ng. This is perhaps the most popular introductory online machine learning class. In addition to being popular, it is also one of the best Machine learning classes any interested student can take to get started with machine learning. 

Here, I have solved the python assignments for the Machine Learning course by Andrew NG, offered by Stanford University on Coursera with complete submission for grading capability.
